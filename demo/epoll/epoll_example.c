/*
 * How to use epoll? A complete example in C
 * on 2 Jun 2011 by Mukund (@muks)
 * Network servers are traditionally implemented using a separate process or thread per connection. 
 * For high performance applications that need to handle a very large number of clients simultaneously, 
 * this approach won't work well, because factors such as resource usage and context-switching time 
 * influence the ability to handle many clients at a time. An alternate method is to perform non-blocking 
 * I/O in a single thread, along with some readiness notification method which tells you when you can 
 * read or write more data on a socket.
 *
 *	This article is an introduction to Linux's epoll(7) facility, which is the best readiness notification 
 *	facility in Linux. We will write sample code for a complete TCP server implementation in C. 
 *	I assume you have C programming experience, know how to compile and run programs on Linux, 
 *	and can read manpages of the various C functions that are used.
 *
 *	epoll was introduced in Linux 2.6, and is not available in other UNIX-like operating systems. 
 *	It provides a facility similar to the select(2) and poll(2) functions:
 *
 *	select(2) can monitor up to FD_SETSIZE number of descriptors at a time, 
 *	typically a small number determined at libc's compile time.
 * poll(2) doesn't have a fixed limit of descriptors it can monitor at a time, 
 * but apart from other things, even we have to perform a linear scan of all the passed descriptors 
 * every time to check readiness notification, which is O(n) and slow.
 * epoll has no such fixed limits, and does not perform any linear scans. 
 * Hence it is able to perform better and handle a larger number of events.
 *
 * An epoll instance is created by epoll_create(2) or epoll_create1(2) (they take different arguments), 
 * which return an epoll instance. epoll_ctl(2) is used to add/remove descriptors to be watched on the 
 * epoll instance. To wait for events on the watched set, epoll_wait(2) is used, which blocks until 
 * events are available. Please see their manpages for more info.
 *
 *	When descriptors are added to an epoll instance, they can be added in two modes: 
 *	level triggered and edge triggered. When you use level triggered mode, and data is available for reading, 
 *	epoll_wait(2) will always return with ready events. If you don't read the data completely, 
 *	and call epoll_wait(2) on the epoll instance watching the descriptor again, it will return again with a 
 *	ready event because data is available. In edge triggered mode, you will only get a readiness notfication 
 *	once. If you don't read the data fully, and call epoll_wait(2) on the epoll instance watching the 
 *	descriptor again, it will block because the readiness event was already delivered.
 *
 *	The epoll event structure that you pass to epoll_ctl(2) is shown below. With every descriptor being watched, 
 *	you can associate an integer or a pointer as user data.

/*
 * main() first calls create_and_bind() which sets up the socket. It then makes the socket non-blocking, 
 * and then calls listen(2). It then creates an epoll instance in efd, to which it adds the listening 
 * socket sfd to watch for input events in an edge-triggered mode.
 *
 * The outer while loop is the main events loop. It calls epoll_wait(2), where the thread remains 
 * blocked waiting for events. When events are available, epoll_wait(2) returns the events in the 
 * events argument, which is a bunch of epoll_event structures.
 *
 * The epoll instance in efd is continuously updated in the event loop when we add new incoming connections 
 * to watch, and remove existing connections when they die.
 *
 * When events are available, they can be of three types:
 *	Errors: When an error condition occurs, or the event is not a notification about data available for reading, 
 *	we simply close the associated descriptor. Closing the descriptor automatically removes it from the watched 
 *	set of epoll instance efd.
 *
 *	New connections: When the listening descriptor sfd is ready for reading, it means one or more new connections 
 *	have arrived. While there are new connections, accept(2) the connections, print a message about it, make the 
 *	incoming socket non-blocking and add it to the watched set of epoll instance efd.
 *	Client data: When data is available for reading on any of the client descriptors, we use read(2) to read the 
 *	data in pieces of 512 bytes in an inner while loop. This is because we have to read all the data that is 
 *	available now, as we won't get further events about it as the descriptor is watched in edge-triggered mode. 
 *	The data which is read is written to stdout (fd=1) using write(2). If read(2) returns 0, it means an EOF and 
 *	we can close the client's connection. If -1 is returned, and errno is set to EAGAIN, it means that all data 
 *	for this event was read, and we can go back to the main loop.
 *	That's that. It goes around and around in a loop, adding and removing descriptors in the watched set.
 *
 *	Download the epoll-example.c program.
 *
 *	Update1: Level and edge triggered definitions were erroneously reversed (though the code was correct). 
 *	It was noticed by Reddit user bodski. The article has been corrected now. I should have proof-read it 
 *	before posting. Apologies, and thank you for pointing out the mistake. :)
 *
 *	Update2: The code has been modified to run accept(2) until it says it would block, so that if multiple 
 *	connections have arrived, we accept all of them. It was noticed by Reddit user cpitchford. 
 *	Thank you for the comments. :)
